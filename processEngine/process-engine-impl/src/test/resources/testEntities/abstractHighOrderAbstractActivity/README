Example of an HighOrderAbstractActivity

In this example an abstract activity, of type HoAA, behaviour dependens from a variable set as attribute
in the same activity: 

  <tns:abstract name="testHOAA" type="HOAA" receiveVar="TRANSPORTATIONS" />

When ProcessEngine execute this abstract activity, if type HOAA is found, handle it using associated
executable (see handler project), if any.
